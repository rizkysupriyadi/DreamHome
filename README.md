This project is built with React and Vite.

Vite provides a minimal setup with fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules configured.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React in Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

For production applications, it is recommended to use TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. You can check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
